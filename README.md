CFML-10-Vim
===========
Vim scripts for making ColdFusion 10 development easier.

For simplist installation, use <a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen">Pathogen</a>, otherwise just copy these into your <code>~/.vim</code> or <code>~/vimfiles</code> directory.  These will not overwrite any files that come with the standard VIM 7.3 installation.


This redirects all filetype=cf to filetype=cfml, TO UNINSTALL simply remove the cfml.vim files out of these directories or delete it out of the bundles directory.

The syntax file is started from the cf.vim file included with VIM by Toby Woodwark built around ColdFusion 9.
